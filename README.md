FixAdria
=======

Reverts Adria's greeting in patched *Diablo: Hellfire* back to the original.

It was changed in *Hellfire Patch v1.21 (Unofficial)* to a cow's sounds ('Sfx\Towners\cow1.wav').

### Binary

You **need to have** *.NET framework* installed to run the patcher. Version 2.0 is available from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22808).

Download FixAdria's binary from [here](http://draakon.masendav.org/binaries/FixAdria-v1.0.0.0.zip).

### Notes

Excuse my somewhat sloppy code: it was written back in 2007. But hey, it works and is a simple application, so not much point of refactoring it. Of course, if you would like to do that, then you're welcome to make a pull request :).
